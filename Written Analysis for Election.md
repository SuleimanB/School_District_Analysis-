Overview of Election Audit

Election_Audit Summary

Business proposal on how this script can be used for any election with some modifications (2 examples)

This script can be modified to be used in different levels of government and there respective elections if all that is required is a voting count. A couple of changes to the csv file that the script is analyzing will be able to have the data be analyzed and stringed together in order to come up with the total number of votes, percentages and respective candidates and regions. 

CSV File Path to Modify

Lastly, changes to some labels for some of the values to make it more representative of either the region, the meaningful value to tally and percentages between candidates would be good examples for how this code can be taken and modified as a simple tool to tally and showcase significant results from a given election as long as the given CSV file as mentioned has either the same format or the code changes which columns to pull the data from.
